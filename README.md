# Quickstart

This quickstart demonstrates how to build a financial model service that provides stock price predictions and displays dataset information using BentoML. The service includes both REST API and gRPC endpoints.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ and `pip` installed. See the [Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to learn more.

## Get started

Perform the following steps to run this project and deploy it to BentoCloud.

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Serve your model as an HTTP server. This starts a local server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), making your model accessible as a web service.

   ```bash
   bentoml serve service.py:Svc --reload
   ```

3. To serve the gRPC server, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python grpc_server.py
   ```

4. You can test the gRPC client by running:

   ```bash
   python grpc_client.py
   ```

5. Once your service is ready, you can deploy it to [BentoCloud](https://www.bentoml.com/cloud). Make sure you have [logged in to BentoCloud](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/bentocloud/how-tos/manage-access-token.html) and run the following command to deploy it.

   ```bash
   bentoml deploy .
   ```

   **Note**: Alternatively, you can manually build a Bento, [containerize it with Docker](https://docs.bentoml.com/en/latest/guides/containerization.html), and deploy it in any Docker-compatible environment.

## API Endpoints

### REST API

1. **Get Data Head**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:3000/get_data_head"
   ```

2. **Get Prediction and MSE**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:3000/predict" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
   ```

### gRPC API

1. **Get Data Head**

   Run the gRPC client:

   ```bash
   python grpc_client.py
   ```

## Running with Docker Compose

You can run both the gRPC server and client using Docker Compose. Follow these steps:

### 1. Unified Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile named `Dockerfile.unified`:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ENV BENTOML_HOME=/bentoml

# Install Python and other dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv curl && apt-get clean

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Create and activate a virtual environment
RUN python3 -m venv /venv
ENV PATH="/venv/bin:$PATH"

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Install gRPC tools
RUN pip install grpcio grpcio-tools

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 50051

# Copy the entrypoint script
COPY entrypoint.sh /app/entrypoint.sh

# Make the entrypoint script executable
RUN chmod +x /app/entrypoint.sh

# Run the entrypoint script
CMD ["/app/entrypoint.sh"]
```

### 2. Entrypoint Script

Create a script named `entrypoint.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Start the gRPC server in the background
python grpc_server.py &
SERVER_PID=$!

# Wait for the gRPC server to start
echo "Waiting for gRPC server to start..."
sleep 10  # Adjust this time as necessary

# Run the gRPC client
python grpc_client.py

# Wait for the gRPC server process to finish
wait $SERVER_PID
```

Make the entrypoint script executable:

```bash
chmod +x entrypoint.sh
```

### 3. Docker Compose File

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  grpc_service:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.unified
    ports:
      - "50051:50051"
    networks:
      - grpc_network

networks:
  grpc_network:
    driver: bridge
```

### 4. Running Docker Compose

To build and run the services using Docker Compose, use the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

### Clearing Docker Resources

If you need to stop and remove all containers, images, and volumes, use the following commands:

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
docker rmi $(docker images -q) -f
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
```
